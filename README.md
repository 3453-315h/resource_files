## METASPLOIT RESOURCE FILES

<blockquote>Resource scripts provides an easy way for us to automate repetitive tasks in Metasploit. Conceptually they're just like batch scripts, they contain a set of commands that are automatically and sequentially executed when you load the script in Metasploit. You can create a resource script by chaining together a series of Metasploit console commands or by directly embedding Ruby to do things like call APIs, interact with objects in the database, modules and iterate actions.</blockquote>
