## METASPLOIT RESOURCE FILES

<blockquote>Resource scripts provides an easy way for us to automate repetitive tasks in Metasploit. Conceptually they're just like batch scripts, they contain a set of commands that are automatically and sequentially executed when you load the script in Metasploit. You can create a resource script by chaining together a series of Metasploit console commands or by directly embedding Ruby to do things like call APIs, interact with objects in the database, modules and iterate actions.</blockquote>

**This repository contains various resource files to assiste in exploitation or metasploit database related issues.**<br />

### DISCLAMER
The resource scripts this repository contains serves as proof of concept (**POC**) of this [article](https://github.com/r00t-3xp10it/hacking-material-books/blob/master/metasploit-RC%5BERB%5D/metasploit_resource_files.md#metasploit-resource-files) published on resource files scripting. This repository is designed to demonstrate what resource files [ERB](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/custom-scripting/) can accomplish when automating tasks in msfconsole, and they are written to take advantage of multi-hosts-exploitation-scan tasks (manage large databases of hosts) from scanning the local lan for alive hosts, scan attackers input rhosts or scan wan networks in search of rhosts to exploit/brute-force. 'They are **not** written with the objective of exploiting remote targets, but to serve as inspiration for msf developing'. This repository shows above all how [nmap](https://nmap.org/) and [metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/) frameworks are amazing tools.

### Project History
Mosquito.sh (**BASH**) script was written for the purpose of automating the resource files (**ERB**) contained in this [repository](https://github.com/r00t-3xp10it/resource_files). Each resource file is written to allows users to run them in three different ways, from scan the Local Lan, scan user inputs (**RHOSTS**) or randomly scan the **WAN** network for possible targets to add to msfdb.

<br /><br />

### Framework Description
Mosquito as first step uses nmap to seek-recon hosts information (or possible targets), then adds all the hosts found to the msfdb to be used in further recon, assist in exploration or brute force jobs carried out later.

![mosquito_banner](http://i63.tinypic.com/2e5pce9.png)

Mosquito allow us to scan Local Lan or WAN networks using nmap (search-recon) and metasploit (recon-exploration-brute-force), but unlike metasploit the scans performed by nmap will use a fake UserAgent (IPhone/Safari) stealth scans (SYN ack) and mac addr spoofing (--spoof-mac) technics that turns forensic log artifacts analysis more dificult to identify the attacker.

    stealth technics used by mosquito to evade IDS and artifacs logs analysis
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    nmap -sS [stealth scan using SYN ack fragmented header packets]
    nmap --spoof-mac 0 [spoof your mac address for a random one generated by nmap]
    nmap --script-args http.useragent="Apache-HttpClient/4.0.3 (java 1.5)" [spoof your UserAgent]

![mosquito_banner](http://i67.tinypic.com/209iyb7.png)

Mosquito also allow users to scan-brute-force multiple targets (multi-tasking) from user inputs to the import of hosts list files containing ip addresses or randomly seek in WAN for possible targets. Each valid credentials found (brute-force or exploitation) will spawn a shell session to the remote host in msfconsole prompt.

### Framework Dictionary files
Initial the resource scripts that this project contains are written to allow is users to input dictionary file absoluct path before the scan take place, but mosquito ships with is own set of dictionary files to assist in brute force tasks, and it does not allow is users to input another dictionary file when running mosquito framework.

nevertheless mosquito users can improve existing dictionary(s) by edit them before executing mosquito framework, all dictionary files can be found under project working directory in: 'resource_files/bin/worldlists'.

|nmap| WAN random search; recon | [nmap download](https://nmap.org/download.html) * |
|zenity|Bash script GUI interface|[zenity download](https://help.gnome.org/users/zenity/) * |
|geoiplookup| hosts geo location | sudo apt-get install geoip-bin * |
|curl| hosts geo location | sudo apt-get install curl * |
|dig| ip address resolver | Linux native installed package ** |
|http-winrm.nse| http winrm recon | mosquito native nse script * |
|freevulnsearch.nse| CVE recon | mosquito native nse script * |

    * ./mosquito.sh -i = to install packages/scripts/modules
    ** Linux native installed package = no need to install it

**Hint:** All mosquito dependencies can be easy installed by runing: **sudo ./mosquito.sh -i**<br />
Adicionaly to the dependencies described above, diferent resource scripts requires diferent msf auxiliarys
or nmap nse adicional scripts installed, the -i switch in mosquito allow us to download/install all that extra modules fast and easy.

### Framework Limitations
**a)** mosquito only accepts ip addr inputs, not domain names<br />
**b)** brute forcing takes time, use 'CTRL+C' to skip current task(s)<br />
**c)** mosquito dicionarys can be found in resource_files/bin/worldlists<br />
**d)** find valid credentials sometimes fails to spawn a shell<br />
**e)** multiple sessions open migth slowdown your pc<br />

**Hint:** This resource scripts requires that the msf database to be empty of hosts and services data. Thats
the main reason why this scripts creates a new workspace named 'mosquito' and stores all data inside that workspace while working, then the resource script deletes the 'mosquito' workspace in the end of execution.
